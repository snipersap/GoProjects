# ReadMe
This repo is the project *automate-tests* as described in the course [Building Modern Web Applications with Go (Golang)](https://udemy.com/course/building-modern-web-applications-with-go/). 

This repo creates a simple `divide` function that returns an error and the result. Using the `divide` function, we create a few tests that we automate. 

## How to test the repo?
Run the files `main.go` using the command 
`go run main.go`.   

Run the tests with 
`go test`
