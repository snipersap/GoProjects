# ReadMe
This repo is the consolidation of all my go projects as described in the course  [Go: The Complete Developer's Guide (Golang)](https://udemy.com/course/go-the-complete-developers-guide/). 

To view the projects, simply traverse into the respective project folder and execute `go run main.go` and `go test` for running the project and the tests respectively. Each project folder also has its own instructions in their own *readme.md* files.

## Report bugs or suggestions
Please use the *Issues* feature in github to raise one. There is no guarantee or promise to fix it, because, well, this repo is a project after all. However, all suggestions are welcome. 

## Disclaimer
Please use the code here at your own risk. This is a sample project, and may not always provide the expected outcome or result.
