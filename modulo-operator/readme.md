# Fizzbuzz

Go supports the standard modulo operator:
```go
7 % 3 // 1
```
The AND logical operator:
```go 
true && false // false
true && true // true
```
As well as the OR operator:
```go
true || false // true
false || false // false
```
## Assignment

We're hiring engineers at Textio, so time to brush up on the classic "Fizzbuzz" game, a coding exercise that has been dramatically overused in coding interviews across the world.

Complete the fizzbuzz function that prints the numbers 1 to 100 inclusive each on their own line, but replace multiples of 3 with the text fizz and multiples of 5 with buzz. Print fizzbuzz for multiples of 3 AND 5.

Note: This lesson is graded based on the output of your program, so don't leave any debugging print statements in your code.
