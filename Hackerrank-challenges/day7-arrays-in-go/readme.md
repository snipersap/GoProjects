# Hackerrank challenge Day 7: Arrays

## Objective

Today, we will learn about the Array data structure. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video.

## Biggest challenge

The challenge was not in printing the array in reverse but getting a space separated line and converting it from slice of string to integer array.

## Task

Given an array, A, of N integers, print A's elements in reverse order as a single line of space-separated numbers.

## Example

A = [1,2,3,4]  
Print 4 3 2 1. Each integer is separated by one space.

## Input Format

The first line contains an integer, N (the size of our array).
The second line contains N space-separated integers that describe array A's elements.

## Constraints

```bash
1 <= N <= 10000
1 <= A[i] <= 10000, where A[i] is the i<sup>th</sup> integer in the array.
```

## Output Format

Print the elements of array A in reverse order as a single line of space-separated numbers.

## Sample Input

```bash
4
1 4 3 2
```

## Sample Output

```bash
2 3 4 1
```

## Test Result

```bash
Enter the size of the integer array:
4 
Enter the space separated list of integers:1 2 3 4 5 6 
The integer array printed in reverse (upto max size given) is:
4 3 2 1
```
