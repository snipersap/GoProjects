# Hackerrank challenge Day 5: Loops

## Objective

Today we will expand our knowledge of strings, combining it with what we have already learned about loops. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video.

## Task

Given a string, S , of length N that is indexed from 0 to N-1, print its even-indexed and odd-indexed characters as  space-separated strings on a single line (see the Sample below for more detail).

Note: 0 is considered to be an even index.

## Example

s = abdecf  
Print abc def  


## Input Format

The first line contains an integer, T (the number of test cases).
Each line i of the T subsequent lines contain a string, S.

## Constraints

```bash
1 <= T <= 10
2 <= length of S <= 10000
```

## Output Format

For each String S <sub>j</sub> (where ), print S<sub>j</sub>'s even-indexed characters, followed by a space, followed by S<sub>j</sub>'s odd-indexed characters.

## Sample Input

```bash
2
Hacker
Rank
```

## Sample Output

```bash
Hce akr
Rn ak
```

## Test Result

```bash
2
Hacker
Rank
Hce akr
Rn ak  
```
