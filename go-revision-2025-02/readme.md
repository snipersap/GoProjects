# Revision of Go 2025-02
In this folder you will find the revision done after a few weeks of gap. Also forms a milestone for quick revision later. 
Rewriting instead of copying to embed the learnings with muscle memory. 

Not running tests to quick revise. May add tests later. 

### Execution Results

Printf: Hello there Ashok!
Sprintf: Hello Priya from Sprintf, you are 10.46 years old
