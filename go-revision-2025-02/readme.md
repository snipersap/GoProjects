# Revision of Go 2025-02
In this folder you will find the revision done after a few weeks of gap. Also forms a milestone for quick revision later. 
Rewriting instead of copying to embed the learnings with muscle memory. 

Not running tests to quick revise. May add tests later. 

### Execution Results
```bash
Printf: Hello there Ashok!
Sprintf: Hello Priya from Sprintf, you are 10.46 years old
Converting -52 from string to integer gives us:-52, which is of type int
Converting -256 from integer to string gives us:-256, which is of type string        
Parsed boolean value of true = true
Parsed boolean value of hello = false
Parsed boolean value of false = false
Parse string -2673547.36584685 to float32 -2673547.250000000, with type float64      
Parse string -08008111.47237474274725742 to float64 -8008111.472374743, with type float64
Converting floating point number -256.2458777 to string -2.562459e+02, of type string
The bear emoji has length 4 bytes and type string, and length of runes 1
The value of rune r1 is 128059 in unicode, while as a rune it is üêª
Although ageF,a floating point number, is 2.600000, when stored in an integer ageI, it becomes 2
Converting password from int to string gives:„Äπ, of type string, which means direct type casting to string outputs a string of one rune and not digits
Using Itoa function of package strconv, we get the password 12345, as type string    
Same line declarations, Brother's name is Mark and age is 26
Constants declared were pi:3.145600, days in a year: 365, and days in a leap year:366
Days in a leap year, created and computed from constants = 366
Conditionals:
Neither high nor long!
The breadth is adequate.
Conditionals with initial statement in IF:
Time for retirement! Age more than 67. Good for limiting scope of age to the IF condition.
Conditionals with Switch:
First patch of Second Release.
Switch fallthrough:
First Release and/or its patches.
Simple Functions: and pass by value
Before adding, a1:1, a2:2.
Sum from the add function is 4.
After adding, a1:1, a2:2, have not changed as add() args were passed with value.     
Get coordinates with naked return: X:38.711988, y:-9.314092
Early returns with age:
The person is (a/an) about to retire..
Functions as arguments: multiplication of 3 numbers
Multiplying 2,3 and 4: 24
Functions as arguments: Subtraction of 3 numbers
Subtraction of 2,3 and 4 in that sequence: -5
Addition via anonymous function:
The sum of 2 numbers through an anonymous function is: 6
Defer functions:
Task 0 done. Task 1 done. Task 2 done. Task 3 done. Task 4 done. Task 5 done. Target achieved!
Closures access variables outside its own function body.
Little Red riding Hood. Went through the jungle to visit her Granny. The bad wolf waited for his prey disguised as her Granny. Little Red Riding Hood was too smart for the wolf. She got away safely.
My car configuration via nested, named and anonymous struct is: {5 BMW #fff888 i20FR {leather #abcde} {polymer #zzzhhr} {M+S 3.4} {LED 3000 Lumens true}}
Hex value is: 1a, Decimal value is 26
Hex value for 42 is 0x2a
Encoded GoLang string in hex is: 476f6c616e67
Decoded back to String is: Golang
Area of the rectangle via receiver of struct is: 200
The size of the type of myCar (a struct) is:184 bytes
The size of the type of r2 (a struct) is:16 bytes
Empty Struct {}
Rectangle via Single Interface
Area of the shape is: 200
Perimeter of the shape is: 60
Circle via Multiple Interfaces
Area of the shape is: 2827.431
Perimeter of the shape is: 188.4954
The diameter of the 3d shape is: 60
Type assertion: Shape is a rectangle or circle?
The shape is a rectangle with area: 200
The shape is a circle with perimeter: 188.4954
Type switch with Interfaces:
Type is main.rect1
Type is main.circle
Simulate Error interface with custom error:
Error for rectangle with length:1000 and breadth:2000
Demo creating a new error using the errors package:
generated a new error using the Errors package
Demo of pass through error:pass through error caught generated error using errors pkg:generated a new error using the Errors package
Panic and recover!
For loop with init, condition, increment:0;1;2;
For loop with init, no condition, increment:0;1;2;3;4;
For loop with condition only like while loop:0;1;2;
For loop with range over counter:0;1;2;
